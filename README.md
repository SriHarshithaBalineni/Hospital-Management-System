Hospital Management System using HTML,CSS, JS, Node, Express, SQl In the realm of healthcare, organizing and securing patient info is key. This Full-stack project aims to simplify this process.It is an easy-to-use system that stores patient data securely, allows real-time updates, and assists healthcare providers in making quicker, informed decisions. The aim of this project is to bridge technology and healthcare, ensuring data privacy while enhancing overall healthcare experiences.This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to power the front end of our Patient Health Data Management System, resulting in an intuitive and eye-catching user interface. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) forms the backbone, structuring content for seamless navigation. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) steps in to add style, ensuring an attractive and consistent look across the application. JavaScript, being our dynamic scripting language, brings interactivity to the forefront, facilitating real-time updates and responsive features. Together, this trio forms the foundation of our front-end development, promising an intuitive and efficient user experience for healthcare professionals interacting with the system. In Hospital Management System, the full stack implementation includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive frontend. On the backend, Node.js, Expess.js and SQL are used to efficiently handle data storage and retrieval. With this combination we will be able to make Secure, efficient Health care data handling for improved Patient Care. Our Full-stack approach ensures user friendly experience which also emphasis security and efficiency. Node.js which is primarily used on the server side. It handles tasks such as processing data, interacting with databases, and serving dynamic content to clients. Express.js which is a framework for Node.js which handles tasks such as HTTP requests, and implement middleware management for functionalities like authentication, logging. The SQL database further enhances our backend infrastructure, providing a reliable and structured means for storing and retrieving data. Together Node.js, Express.js and SQL form a robust foundation for our backend.
